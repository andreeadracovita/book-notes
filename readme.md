```
await db.query(`
	INSERT INTO books (title, author, isbn, short_description, notes, rating, date_read)
	VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7)
	RETURNING id;
`,
[title, author, isbn, new_short_description || null, new_notes || null, parseInt(rating) || null, new Date(date_read).toISOString().slice(0, 10)]);
```

### Read

Fetching all data sorted by title, date read or rating:
`await db.query("SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY title ASC");`

`await db.query("SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY date_read DESC");`

`await db.query("SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY rating DESC);`


Fetching specific data by id:
`await db.query("SELECT * FROM books WHERE id = $1", [id]);`

### Update

Update data with id:

```
await db.query(`
	UPDATE books
	SET title=$1, author=$2, isbn=$3, short_description=$4, notes=$5, rating=$6, date_read=$7
	WHERE id = $8;`,
	[title, author, isbn, short_description, notes, rating, new Date(date_read).toISOString().slice(0, 10), id]
);
```

```
await db.query("DELETE FROM books WHERE id = $1", [id]);
```
